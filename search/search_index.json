It can be used to display a large number of links in a compact space, making it ideal for websites with many categories or subcategories. In BigCommerce, unfortunately, we don't have an easy way to manage mega menu structures. So we adapt according to the requirements of each project. Please note that since this one is built in JaaScript, it will load icons from category if the user has JavaScript disabled, from example. For Wiring Specialties, we used the Advanced Metafields app interface to make it a bit simpler to add all the links we needed. To edit the Mega Menu, you can go to the Channels metafields in the Advanced Metafields app and edit the structure to each 1 level item in the menu. Each accordion contains a place to edit the title, url, children, and banners. The banners set here will show while the user is hovering over the first level of the menu. They need to follow this HTML format In the children field, we need to follow a specific JSON format to display the second and third levels.

It includes the product name, description, price, options, and an image of the product. Most of the product page is built with the default BigCommerce settings, for more information regarding how to add a product in Bigcommerce with the V2 settings, refer to this documentation . There are some parts on the product page that need to follow specific guidelines. Short Description The short description is a brief description of the product. It should be a short paragraph that describes the product in a few sentences. The short description should be displayed at the top of the product page. It is not mandatory, so not all the products will have it. It is managed inside the Advanced Metafields app, in the Products & Variants, under Catalog List. 'More Info' in product picklist accordion The product picklist is an accordion that allows the user to select different options for the product. To display the 'More info' button in the accordion, we need to add the information in the Metafields as well. This is set in the Channels metafields, under Catalog List. It's important to enter the correct name under the Option Name field, which can be copied from the site itself or from the backend. 'Other' option with input field The 'Other' option with an input field is a custom functionality that allows the user to enter a value in an input when selecting 'Other' option in the checkbox. To add the 'Other' option with an input field, we need to follow some specific guidelines. 1 - Create an invisible product called 'Other'. 2 - Go to one ot the product options that you would like to add the input field. It should be a picklist option. 3 - Add the 'Other' product as the last one. You can change the label. 4 - Then you'll need to create a new multi-line field, with the same name as the option you want to attach it to, and add '- other' at the end. 5 - Make sure to drag the multi-line field option to be right after the option you want to attach it to, in the option sets. Product tabs The product tabs are used to display additional information about the product. The tabs include the description, specifications, shipping info, and FAQ. The content comes from the product description, following a specific format, like the one already set in some of the current products. The format should be as follows: It uses horizontal lines to separate the sections, however, it will not create one tab for each horizontal line The section above the first horizontal line will be the description tab The sections between the first and the last horizontal line will be the specifications tab The section below the last horizontal line will be the FAQ tab The shipping info comes from the 'Availability text' field in the product settings. Similar Items The similar items section displays products that are similar to the current product and they can be added all at once by clicking on the button. Note that this is not the Related Items. The products are set using metafields and they must be simple products (with no variants or modifiers). In the Advanced Metafields app, go to the Products & Variants section, under Catalog List. Under 'Similar Products', enter the id of the products you would like to display. You can get the product id from the url of the product in the backend Related Items The related items section displays products that are related to the current product. These are usually automatically picked by BigCommerce or can be set manually in the product settings.
